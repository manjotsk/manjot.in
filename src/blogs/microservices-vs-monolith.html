    <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
      <p>Let’s cut through the noise. If you’ve spent enough time building, scaling, or salvaging digital products, you’ve probably been hit with the “microservices vs monolith” question more than once. Everyone has a strong opinion. And like most tech debates, the right answer is: <span class="highlight">“It depends.”</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Monolith: One House, One Roof</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">A <span class="highlight">monolith</span> is your all-in-one app. Everything is tightly integrated—your backend, frontend, and logic live together in one place.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Ship fast, ideal for MVPs</li>
        <li>Easier to debug and deploy</li>
        <li>Harder to scale with teams</li>
        <li>Partial failures affect the whole system</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">I still remember building our first productivity tool as a monolith. It let us move at lightning speed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Microservices: Divide and Rule</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">Microservices are independent services that talk to each other over APIs or queues. Perfect for scalability, but they come with overhead.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Scale parts of your system independently</li>
        <li>Autonomous teams, safer deployments</li>
        <li>DevOps complexity increases</li>
        <li>Network latency & failure points</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">While building a logistics platform, the load tracking started dragging billing. That’s when we split into microservices—it saved us.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">In another case, I moved a cloud-based microservice app to an on-prem monolith for a client in China—it got <span class="highlight">insanely faster</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">When to Choose What?</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Start with a monolith for fast iteration</li>
        <li>Split when teams grow and features bottleneck each other</li>
        <li>If features evolve independently, microservices make sense</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">One of our HR tools never needed splitting—it was clean, single-use, and stayed that way. Overengineering kills momentum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="neo-box p-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Final Word</h2>
      <p>Architecture isn’t permanent. It evolves. Be honest with your bottlenecks. Refactor when needed. Don’t choose one style forever—choose what lets you <span class="highlight">ship fast and sleep well</span>.</p>
