      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold neo-box p-4 mb-8">The Rise of Consumer AI & Its Impact on Rural India</h1>
  
      <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
        <p>I’m from <span class="highlight">Amritsar, Punjab</span>—a place rich in culture, but equally full of ambition. Over the years, I've had the chance to build tools and platforms for real-world use—ones that simplify work, empower small teams, and scale without needing Silicon Valley budgets.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">And now, I’m witnessing something powerful: <span class="highlight">Consumer AI</span> is not only evolving—it’s transforming India’s rural heartland in ways we couldn’t imagine a few years ago.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What is Consumer AI?</h2>
        <p>It’s not about billion-parameter models in data centers. It’s about AI tools that live on phones, work offline, understand native language, and solve real-life problems.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Voice assistants that translate between Punjabi and English</li>
          <li>Camera-based tools that scan crops and give advice</li>
          <li>Speech-to-text that helps workers log tasks hands-free</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">My AI Journey</h2>
        <p>I’ve built productivity platforms that used AI for auto-follow-ups, HR tools that recorded logs via voice, and language learning apps that translated in real-time.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">In one case, we moved a SaaS product from cloud microservices to an on-prem monolith running locally in India. With embedded AI modules, it ran faster and offline—perfect for rural setups.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What’s Changing in Rural India?</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Farmers diagnose crops with a smartphone</li>
          <li>Village shopkeepers generate invoices using voice</li>
          <li>Frontline workers take attendance using face detection</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">And all of it works on phones under ₹10,000. No fancy servers. No fiber lines. Just AI that meets people where they are.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="neo-box p-4 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Challenges</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>AI still struggles with dialect accuracy</li>
          <li>Data privacy is a grey zone for most users</li>
          <li>Digital infra like power and backups remains unstable in pockets</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">But these are solvable. We’re not waiting for perfect—just practical.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="neo-box p-4">
        <p>Growing up in Amritsar, I never thought someone in a nearby pind would be able to speak into a phone and file a loan form or identify pests on their crops using AI. But today, it’s reality.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">As builders, this is our opportunity. <span class="highlight">Don’t just build for cities</span>. Build for Amritsar. Build for every village that’s ready for tech—just waiting for the right tool to reach them.</p>
